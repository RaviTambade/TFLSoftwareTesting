### 🧑‍🏫 *Mentor’s Corner: Functional Testing in Action — The Online Shopping Experience*

---

**"Hi testers-in-the-making! 👋 Welcome to today’s session!"**

Imagine this: You're helping a startup build their very first online shopping platform. Think of it like Amazon, Flipkart, or Meesho — where a customer wants to browse, buy, and receive a product effortlessly.

And your job?
To become the **user's guardian angel** — ensuring **every feature works exactly as it should**.

That’s what **Functional Testing** is all about.

Let me walk you through a typical day in our tester's shoes — using real examples and scenarios.

---

### 📌 **Scene 1: The First Door – Registration and Login**

> "As a new user, I want to sign up, sign in, and manage my access securely."

**Functional Test Cases**:

* ✅ *Test Case 1*: Does the registration work with valid credentials?
* ❌ *Test Case 2*: What if I try registering again with the same email? Does the system stop me?
* 🔐 *Test Case 3 & 4*: Can users log in securely? Is there proper feedback if they mess up their password?
* 💬 *Test Case 5*: Are error messages clear and helpful?

**Mentor Insight**:

> "This is your front gate. If it’s rusty or broken, no one will ever enjoy the beautiful house (platform) behind it."

---

### 📌 **Scene 2: The Shop Floor – Browsing and Searching**

> "As a shopper, I want to browse products, filter them, and view details before buying."

**Test Like a User**:

* 🛍 *Test Case 6-7*: Can I find what I need using a keyword or category? Do results make sense?
* 📁 *Test Case 8*: Does category navigation feel smooth — like browsing through aisles in a supermarket?
* 🖼 *Test Case 9*: Are product details like photos, price, availability accurate?
* 🔍 *Test Case 10*: What happens when I sort by price or filter by brand?

**Mentor Insight**:

> “You are the first-level quality inspector. If a product can’t be found or has the wrong price… sale lost!”

---

### 📌 **Scene 3: The Shopping Cart – Add to Cart & Checkout**

> "As a buyer, I want to fill my cart, update it, and pay easily."

**Functional Checks**:

* 🧺 *Test Case 11-13*: Can I add items to cart? Can I update quantity or remove them?
* 🧾 *Test Case 14-16*: During checkout, can I choose payment & shipping options, and complete the purchase?

**Mentor Tip**:

> “Cart is like the customer’s wallet — don’t mess with it! Every issue here = abandoned cart.”

---

### 📌 **Scene 4: My Account – Profile and Orders**

> "As a regular customer, I want to update my info and see what I bought."

**Think Like a Power User**:

* 👤 *Test Case 17-18*: Can I change my address, phone, or password?
* 📦 *Test Case 19*: Does the order history show the right status? Can I track shipping?
* 🚪 *Test Case 20*: Can I log out cleanly on all devices?

**Mentor Insight**:

> “If the profile and history aren’t clear, customers feel lost. Test every pixel like it’s your bank account!”

---

### 📌 **Scene 5: The Cash Counter – Payments**

> "As a customer, I want to pay quickly and securely."

**Critical Test Area**:

* 💳 *Test Case 21*: Test every payment mode — card, UPI, PayPal.
* 🔒 *Test Case 22*: Is the transaction encrypted? Any vulnerability?
* 📧 *Test Case 23*: Do I get a receipt and email confirmation?

**Mentor Tip**:

> "This is **mission critical**. A bug here doesn’t just lose money — it loses **trust**."

---

### 📌 **Scene 6: The Big Picture – Integrations & Compatibility**

> "As a business, I want my eCommerce platform to work across systems and partners."

**Real World Coverage**:

* 🔗 *Test Case 24*: Does the site integrate properly with payment gateways & shipping APIs?
* 🧪 *Test Case 25*: Does it work well across Chrome, Safari, Android, iPhone, etc.?

**Mentor Insight**:

> "A great product that crashes on mobile… is not great. Be the cross-platform watchdog!"

---

## 👨‍🏫 Mentor Summary
