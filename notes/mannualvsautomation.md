## Manual vs Automation Testing – A Journey Through Two Worlds

> *"Hey team! Before we begin today's session, I want you to imagine you’re a detective trying to find hidden problems in a brand-new shopping mall. Sometimes you’ll walk through it yourself, inspecting every corner. Other times, you’ll set up cameras and sensors to monitor everything for you — even when you’re sleeping. That’s the world of **Manual Testing** and **Automation Testing**."*

### 🧭 The First Route: **Manual Testing – The Human Touch**

Let me tell you about Sneha — a passionate tester in our team.

Sneha loves exploring apps the way a real user would. She notices small things others miss: button alignment, broken links, spelling mistakes, or an unresponsive page. When we built the login page of our eCommerce app, she *manually* tried every combination — correct password, wrong password, blank field, all caps, etc.

Why? Because manual testing is all about **intuition + observation**.

Here’s how Sneha tests:

🔹 **Exploratory Testing** – No script. Just eyes, brain, and curiosity. She “walks through” the application to feel the experience and spot surprises.

🔹 **Ad-hoc Testing** – One day she clicked the ‘Pay’ button five times fast… and found a bug! That wasn’t in the test plan. That’s ad-hoc.

🔹 **Usability Testing** – She checks if a new user can finish checkout without calling customer care.

🔹 **UAT (User Acceptance Testing)** – She becomes the user’s voice and says, “This feature is correct technically, but it's *not what the customer wants*.”

🔹 **Regression Testing** – When we fix a bug in Cart, she re-tests the Cart *and* the Checkout, just in case.

🔹 **Smoke Testing** – Just after a new build is deployed, Sneha does a quick round of “Is it even alive?” checks.

🧠 **Lesson from Sneha’s world:** Manual testing gives **empathy** and **depth**, but it's time-consuming and not ideal for repeating the same test 100 times.

### 🤖 The Second Route: **Automation Testing – Let the Bots Work While You Sleep**

Now meet Ramesh — our test automation whiz. While Sneha finds the weird edge cases, Ramesh builds scripts to **run 500 test cases in 10 minutes**.

Ramesh doesn’t test by clicking. He **writes code** that tests your code!

Here’s his superpower set:

🛠️ **Functional Testing** – He builds scripts that test “Add to Cart” and “Apply Discount Code” exactly as per the business rules.

🛠️ **Regression Testing** – His scripts re-run automatically every night, so we know if yesterday’s code broke anything.

🛠️ **API Testing** – While others test on UI, he talks directly to the system using tools like Postman or RestAssured.

🛠️ **Performance Testing** – He uses tools like JMeter to simulate 1000 users and check how fast the site responds.

🛠️ **GUI Testing** – His Selenium scripts “click” buttons, “enter” data, and even take screenshots!

🔁 **Reusability** – His scripts can be used again and again, across environments.

⚙️ **CI/CD Integration** – His scripts run automatically whenever new code is pushed, giving instant feedback to developers.

🧠 **Lesson from Ramesh’s world:** Automation brings **speed, consistency, and efficiency**, but it needs time to set up, and it doesn’t *think* like humans do.

## 🔄 So, Which One is Better?

Let me tell you the truth I’ve learned in 15+ years…

👉 **Manual testing is like tasting food with your own tongue. Automation is like using sensors in the kitchen to maintain perfect temperature. You need both to serve the perfect dish.**

We always follow a **blended approach**:

* Start with manual testing to understand the flow and find hidden bugs.
* Automate repetitive tasks (like login, checkout) to save time.
* Use manual testing for UI/UX, exploratory, and edge cases.
* Use automation for regression, performance, and smoke tests.

## 🧪 Real-World Challenge for You

I give my students this assignment:

🎯 Build a simple login form.

1. **Test it manually** – try blank inputs, special characters, long passwords.
2. Then write **Selenium automation** to test the same.
3. Compare time, ease, and bugs found.

You’ll realize when to trust your instincts… and when to let the bots take over.

## 💬 Final Mentor Thought

> “Testing isn’t just about checking software. It’s about ensuring that someone’s real-world goal — ordering groceries, booking a cab, or accessing their money — *doesn’t fail*. Whether it’s your eyes or your scripts, always test with that responsibility in mind.”
